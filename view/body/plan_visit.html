                                <span class="mdc-atten">If you are traveling abroad for medical reasons for the first time, here are certain pointers to help you plan your journey better.</span>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Ask your doctor if you are fit to travel overseas with your medical condition.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Once you decide to continue your treatment abroad, keep your local doctor informed so that you can continue your follow up treatment without a hitch.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">When selecting the international hospital that's right for your needs, you should consider the hospital's accreditation, awards and recognitions, facility and equipments, etc.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Check the credentials and experience of the doctor who will treat you.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Find out about the procedure and compare your expectations with what's achievable by the surgery. Also enquire about follow-up care needed, time required for recovery, physical therapy, etc.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Please note that in most cases the final decisions on your treatment will be made only after the doctor meets you and examines you in person. It is possible that your doctor, upon examining you, may decide you are not fit for surgery, or recommends treatment different from what you planned.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Certain documents must always be with you. Ensure that you carry multiple copies of the same and keep the originals in a safe place when abroad. </p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Records like X-Rays, MRI's, health histories, photographs, immunization records, prescriptions, and any other health records relevant to the surgery. Remember to carry all these medical reports and any medicines in your carry-on luggage.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Passport and visa: You will need a passport for yourself and your travel companion (if any). Depending upon the country you are traveling from, you may or may not need a visa.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Credit cards, debit cards and travelers checks: Bring some local currency, travelers checks and one or two major credit cards and debit cards.</p>
                                <p class="mdc-list">Carry your driver's license or any valid proof of identity and make sure it will remain valid while you're traveling.</p>
